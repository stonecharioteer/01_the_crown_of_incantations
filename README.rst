.. note::

    This is the first part of the Blinder Trilogy, a work of fantasy fiction that
    is part of the Regenesis series.


A Sorcerer-King sits on the throne of an empire that was once home to mighty
wielders of the Energy. Kro is wise beyond his years and hopes to keep his
subjects happy and his kingdom safe. However, elements beyond his control wish
to change that. As he leaves on a quest to find a family heirloom that is
supposed to hold unfathomable power as a favour to an old Wizard, his kingdom
stands risk of being attacked by Teria, a nation run by Kro's brother Yagnik.

Can Kro save his kingdom, or will he lose everything?
