2. The Name That Is Forgotten
==============================

Giko stared at the cloaked man who walked through the gates. It was almost
midnight. The Ahvansh Guard kept the roads safe but no man could be fool
enough to walk around at night alone.

At forty seven, Giko had served the Terian army back in the days of its rule.
He had cast down the sword like so many others once Krono-Kroman took over
Straasfore. Now the night guard of Murrey-El, the largest village in Masto
Lage, he was more than happy, and besides, it was always a pleasure to serve
the people of Masto Lage, and to serve the mayor, Gawin Oreille.

He watched as the black cloaked stranger walked towards the Oreille inn and
wondered who the man was. If he meant trouble, the Ahvansh Guard who were
stationed at Murrey-El would be more than enough to deal with him.

-------------------------------------------

Gawin Oreille did not look like he was nearing sixty. In fact, some people
claimed that he was still young enough to father four more daughters. He
didn’t think his wife Tyna would have been up to the job though. Sitting with
his feet on the serving table, he raised a clear mug of his best ale to his
lips and sipped it. It was sweet and sour at once, just the way he had learnt
to make it in the ten years that he had run this inn, and fortune favoured
him. Most people deemed it a sin to come into the Westlands and not taste
Oreille Ale.

The inn was not too crowded today. He put that down to the fact that most of
the people had gone to Emansun to see the King: that had become a monthly
ritual of late. He smiled as he took another sip. He’d been the Master of
Arms under the Overlord when Teria still ruled over Straasfore, and he’d seen
Krono-Kroman grow. He had always known that the boy was worth something more.

Thinking about his days in the army made him look at the curved scimitar that
hung over the fireplace. He had used many swords in his life, earning him the
title of Blademaster even, but that one was always special. When his
grandfather gave it to him, he had said that blade could not be notched, and
in the twelve years that he had used it, Gawin Oreille had discovered that
there was no truer fact than that.

Cold night air burst into the inn, making some of the customers glance at the
door. Oreille raised his head from his tankard and watched as a black-cloaked
hooded man, taller than anyone he had seen in his entire life, walked in.

The man turned his head from side to side and studied the people in the inn
as though searching for someone. His face was shrouded in shadow but when
he looked in Oreille’s direction; the innkeeper was sure that the man’s eyes
were trying to burn holes through him.

Gawin Oreille had seen scarier things than a black-cloaked man with an air of
death around him, and he was not interested in him. It was almost time for
him to go sleep.

The man walked towards him. He walked in a fashion that betrayed the fact
that a longsword hung at his hip. Oreille looked up at him as the man stood
next to him.

“It’s late, stranger,” he said, speaking Worish, “I hope you’re not here to
ask for a room. Ale is available, but I’m afraid we just filled our last room
about two hours ago.”

He didn’t expect what happened next, the hooded stranger grabbed him by
his collar and hauled him to his feet. The tankard of ale dropped to the
floor, spilling the contents on the carpet. He winced at the thought of a
stain and immediately looked at the man who was now dangling him several
inches off the ground.

“Calm down, stranger. There’s always Sal’s place. He doesn’t stock my ale
though. But he’s a good man. His rooms are a bit cheaper as well.” If nothing
else, his years as the Master of Arms had taught him that calm was often the
best way to solve any situation. Though, as an afterthought, his eyes darted
at the scimitar.

The man raised his head and, from beneath the hood, his lower jaw became
visible as he snarled. Gawin Oreille’s eyes narrowed. Bluish grey skin.
*What is he?* Only then did Oreille notice the man’s long-lobed ears.
Yet there was one thing different from his own long-lobed ears.
The man’s lobes were split in halves.

*Is he an Elwash?*

The other people in the inn were shouting now. Gasto, the large usher was
staggering towards the tall man clearly wondering if he stood a chance. A
few others began approaching behind him and that gave him the courage to put
a hand on the man’s shoulder.

With a grunt, the man hurled Gawin Oreille at the table beside the fireplace
and spun to punch Gasto in the ribs. The usher fell to his knees almost
immediately. Oreille coughed as he clambered to his knees. He blinked once
at his daughters who were screaming now. *Calm.*

The man looked down at him and moved his right hand to the black hilt
of his sword.

Gawin Oreille whirled around and drew the scimitar from the wall.
The leathery hilt felt right in his hand. He hadn’t used it in several years
but he hadn’t forgotten one bit.

As an afterthought, he realised that it would be better to take this outside.

“What do you say we go outside, stranger?” he said, pushing the table aside
to clear space in case the man disagreed.

The man drew his sword. It was completely black. The blade shone in the
firelight, reflecting the dancing flames on its oily, lucid surface.
The blade was single-edged and long. The hilt was meant to be used with two
hands, but the man wielded it with just one. No sooner had he drawn the
sword, the man appeared a hundred times more dangerous than before.

Gawin Oreille heard his daughters shriek. He drowned the words in his stance.
There was only the blade and the circle in which his movements were limited.
*Only the blade.*

Thankfully, the man began walking towards the door with his sword at his side.

Sighing, Oreille followed him into the cold night. The moon was
half-full today. The eerie moonlight illuminated everything the street-lamps
did not. The street in front of his inn was wide enough for ten horses to
walk abreast.

On the other side of the street, the wooden wall separated them from the
sparse thickets of the woods surrounding the village. Murrey-El was an old
village, but it was still modest.

The man looked at Oreille and for an instant his eyes seemed to gleam through
the shadows that hid his face.

“Where is Elvindore?” the man said.

For a moment, the strangeness of that didn’t strike Oreille. He blinked when
he realised what the man had said. *Entaney il Elvindore?*

“You speak Amanian?” Only the near-immortal Elwash, and very few Humans,
spoke that language now.

The man darted at him with an incredible speed. The amount of power with
which he was wielding his black blade was phenomenal. Gawin Oreille fell
back a little before he drove his feet against the ground and stopped himself.

The man lunged again, slashing the sword sideways. Oreille defended with a
backhanded slash. The curved blade pushed back the black long-sword with ease.
The way the man moved was shocking.

*He can’t be an Elwash. What is he?*

The man disappeared.

By instinct, Oreille’s blade swung upwards to protect himself from the man’s
attack. For a slight instant, he’d appeared in the air above him. The circle
in which the opponent moved became a sphere now.

«He can use the Jokann?» Gawin Oreille’s thoughts rushed as he stepped onto
the plane of Energy that the Elwash called the Teyan-mass. It was like a
realm where time had no meaning. Direction and distance made no sense.
It was used to move long distances in a split second by Elwash in their
battles.

Again their blades clashed. This time, Oreille attacked with fervour. He
hadn’t fought like this in decades. The man wasn’t an Elwash, but he wasn’t a
Human either. The Jokann, the method of using the Teyan-mass and its lesser
equivalent, the Te-lan, was something only Elwash could use. He had never
used this against a Human opponent. In fact he had never used it after
finishing his training at Elvindore, under his grandfather.

The sound of steel against steel echoed through the street. The people were
watching on, trying to make sense out of what was happening.

Oreille let his senses take control. Nothing existed in the Teyan-mass.
Not even air. Which was why no one used it for long periods. Overuse could
rip apart flesh from even an Elwash’s body, and he was only half Elwash.

*I can’t let this drag on.*

He stepped out of the Teyan-mass and stood on firm ground, taking slow and
deep breaths. Whoever this person was, he was strong enough to use the plane
like an Elwash. That meant there was no fighting him there like an equal.

*Calm. Be the blade that dances in the circle.*

He closed his eyes and let his senses govern his movements. At once, he could
see the man darting towards him on the Elwash plane. He was a fool to try a
straight attack.

Gawin Oreille held the scimitar with both hands and put one foot in front of
another. Bracing himself, he spun just as the man stepped out of the
Teyan-mass to attack him. This time there was no sound of steel against steel.
Only that of blood dripping to the ground.

After his father had died, he’d been taken to Elvindore to study there.
He didn’t like living there, he felt so different compared to the others.
He wasn’t an Elwash. He was a Human. But his grandfather had tried his best
to change that. Although he could use the Elwash techniques, the Jokann,
he was still not an Elwash. He was not.

He looked at the black blade that was in his ribs. Blood rushed to his mouth.
He spat, coughing for air. His eyes watered as he stared into his opponent’s
face. The blue-skinned being had black, cold eyes.

“Why?” he asked.

The being pulled out his sword and raised Oreille off the ground by the neck.
His vision began to dim. He could still make out the man’s shape but the world flickered.

He remembered his mother’s touch. She had been an Elwash, and the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen. He wondered if she really had died like his
father had claimed. After all, Elwash were almost immortal.

The man pulled him close and whispered into his long-lobed ears.

*“Enas Raeil.”*

Before the world faded to black, Gawin Oreille heard another voice. It did
not speak as all other beings spoke, but it somehow wordlessly asked him a question.

*What do you choose, Elwash?*

Gawin Oreille’s last thought was that he wished he could have told his
grandfather Esanara just how indebted he was to him.

-------------------------------------------

There was no body to claim of Gawin Oreille, the next day. Villagers began
spreading the tale of what happened, though they saw little in the darkness.
They said a man who wielded a blade of black fire cut down Oreille who’d
cried like a helpless babe. Some said Oreille and the man ran into the
forest and killed each other there. Others claimed that there had been
no fight and that Oreille had run away with the man to find his way back
into his old blade-master life.

But one thing remained the same in all the accounts. His clothes were found
in front of the inn, cut in several places and soaked in his blood, and his
daughters and wife had them buried assuming him dead as the stone that marked
the spot.

Some wondered if it meant the end was coming. Others whether the man was some
dark lord who would kill them all in one day, and others merely wondered if
the price of the last caskets of Oreille Ale would skyrocket. But none of
them knew the truth.

The world quivered for the Name That Is Forgotten was spoken once again.
So it began. *From the precipice of a dream.*
