4. Merlock’s Debt
==================

..
    Kro feels better the next day. He asks the Khaay to name what they want in
    return for saving his life.  Khanull tells him they come from Memlus
    Arelus’s old friend Merlock who saved his life.  They’re asking repayment
    for a far, far older debt. And Merlock wants the Crown.

Kroman frowned. “I have told you what you want to know. Now it is your turn.
Why are you here?”

Gorto rose and dusted the front of his trousers. He took his staff in his hand
and said, “Merlock asks you to give him the Crown of Incantations.”
