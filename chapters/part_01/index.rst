Part One: To the Second Continent

    Thrice was the world rent,

    Once in our infancy,

    Then by our heinous bent.

    The last time, it was by you.

    Oh Sons of Timmel! It was by you.

    The mists rise past the dead and rotten.

    Great sovereigns rise and fall.

    The Song of Creation is forgotten.

    But the One shall rule ye all.

    -- Excerpt from the Annals of Cataranan.
