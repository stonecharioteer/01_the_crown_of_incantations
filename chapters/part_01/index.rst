Part One: To the Second Continent
===================================

::

    Thrice was the world rent,
    Once in our infancy,
    Then by our heinous bent.
    The last time, it was by you.
    Oh Sons of Timmel! It was by you.

    - Author Unknown


    The mists rise past the dead and rotten.
    Great sovereigns rise and fall.
    The Song of Creation is forgotten.
    But the One shall rule ye all.

    - Excerpt from the Annals of Cataranan.
